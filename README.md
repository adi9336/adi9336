# 👋 Hi, I’m Aditya Gupta  
**Engineering student · AI & Dev-Tools Enthusiast**

---

### 🚀 About Me  
- Currently building intelligent tools and productivity apps using **Python**, **React**, **LangChain**, **N8N** and related technologies.  
- Passionate about agentic AI workflows, full-stack productivity automation, and bridging Dev + ML.  
- Always learning: deepening my grasp of **AI Engineering**, LLM-based systems, and developer tooling.  
- Open to new opportunities and collaborations — let’s build cool things together!

---

### 🛠 What I Work On  
- **LLM-powered Assistants**: e.g., long-term-memory agents, real-time web search integration, context-aware responses  
- **Full-Stack Applications**: Combining React frontends, FastAPI backends, PostgreSQL / cloud DB, and external APIs  
- **Automation / Integration**: Using N8N-style workflow tools + custom code to connect systems, data, and AI
